Installation
Anaconda Navigator V.1.10.0 was utilised, with the code being written using Jupyter Notebook V.6.1.4. Python version 3 was used. There were no further installations required, beyond standard packages provided within Python versions 3.*. These were: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib  

Project Motivation
This Project is part of Lesson 1 of the Udacity Nanodegree, where the aim was to identify and analyse 3-5 business questions using the Stack Overflow 2017 Survey data. For this analyses I chose to focus on 3 questions relating to Satisfaction of Respondents and influence that Parents have on their children’s careers:
1.	Firstly, are Respondents to the Survey looking for new Job opportunities?

2.	What are the different ways of working, measured though how often someone is working from home, and does this flexible working bring Satisfaction? 

3.	Does the Education level of a parent have any bearing on the education level of the Respondent?

File Descriptions
There is only one notebook for this analysis, it is a self-contained notebook which will produce the output for each of the 3 stated questions. The notebook has been separated into sections
At the start of the Notebook the business questions have been stated along with how they will be approached/ answered with the data provided. After each question cells have been used to provide interpretation of the output.  
Results
Cells within the Notebook provide some interpretation of the results, the main findings however, can be found at the following Medium post.
